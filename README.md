# 🧠 LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my attempts at solving **LeetCode problems**.  
It serves as a personal log of my journey toward improving problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and overall programming fluency.

Each file represents a solution to a specific problem.  
There is **no defined folder structure yet** — files will be organized over time as the collection grows.

## ✅ Purpose
- Practice data structures & algorithms
- Track progress over time
- Explore multiple solution approaches
- Build a reference for future revisits

## 🔄 Ongoing
This repo will be updated continuously as I solve more problems and refine existing solutions.

Happy coding!
